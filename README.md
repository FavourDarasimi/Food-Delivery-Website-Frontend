# Blossom - Modern Food Delivery Frontend üçî

A responsive and feature-rich frontend for a food delivery web application built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. This project showcases a clean user interface, intuitive state management with the Context API, and a seamless user experience from browsing the menu to placing an order.

- **Responsive Design:** The UI is beautifully crafted with Tailwind CSS to be fully responsive across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **Multi-Step Checkout Process:** A user-friendly, multi-step form for collecting personal and delivery address information to complete an order.
- **Global State Management:** Utilizes React's Context API (`StoreContext`) to manage application-wide state for the shopping cart and menu data, ensuring a single source of truth.
- **Modern UI Components:** Includes a reusable modal for login/signup (`AccountAccess`) and cleanly structured components for a scalable and maintainable codebase.
