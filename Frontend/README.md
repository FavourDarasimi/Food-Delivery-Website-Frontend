-   **Responsive Design:** The UI is beautifully crafted with Tailwind CSS to be fully responsive across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
-   **Multi-Step Checkout Process:** A user-friendly, multi-step form for collecting personal and delivery address information to complete an order.
-   **Global State Management:** Utilizes React's Context API (`StoreContext`) to manage application-wide state for the shopping cart and menu data, ensuring a single source of truth.
